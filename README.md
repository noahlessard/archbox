## Source code for the archbox:ryo website

Check out a live page at https://bit.ly/3cbrhie!

This is a demo website, written to showcase another project of mine. The website shows an ability to write basic html and css with responsive design elements. It also shows an ability to use node.js and express to host a webpage, and an ability to connect with aws and cloud hosting. I hope to expand it one day with javascript and more interactive elements. I also hope to clean up some of the css code used to write it.

If you are curious about the archbox project, a write up for that is in the works! The page is currently very long and is taking a long time to sound coherent.

## Source code for the archbox:ryo website

Check out a live page at https://bit.ly/3cbrhie!

This is a demo website, written to showcase another project of mine. The website shows an ability to write basic html and css with responsive design elements. It also shows an ability to use node.js and express to host a webpage, and an ability to connect with aws and cloud hosting. I hope to expand it one day with javascript and more interactive elements. I also hope to clean up some of the css code used to write it.

If you want to know more about creating your own archbox, check out the guide in the repo. It should be called arch-box-install. Best viewed in the github browser. Feedback on the guide is alway appreciated!
